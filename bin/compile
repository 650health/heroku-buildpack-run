# This buildpack can be used for executing custom commands on the build dyno.
#
# A list of user-specified file (specified by the config var BUILDPACK_RUN, or,
# by default, ./buildpack-run.sh) is sourced on the build dyno at compile time.
#
# Note: sourcing means that the commands in the file(s) are executed in the
#       current shell.
#
# The working directory is the root directory of the app.
#
# ---
#
# The 'compile' script is executed by the slug compiler with three arguments:
#   $1: build_dir, location of your app directory on the build dyno
#   $2: cache_dir, directory on the build dyno that persists between builds
#   $3: env_dir, directory holding all the app's config vars as files
#
